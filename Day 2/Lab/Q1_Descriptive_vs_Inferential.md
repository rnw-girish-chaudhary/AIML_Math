# Descriptive vs Inferential Statistics

## Descriptive Statistics
- **What it does:** Summarizes *what the data shows*.
- **Typical outputs:** count, mean, median, mode, min, max, range, variance, standard deviation, percentiles, histograms, boxplots.
- **When used:** To describe a dataset you already have—no generalization to a larger population.

## Inferential Statistics
- **What it does:** Uses a *sample* to make statements about a *population*.
- **Typical tools:** Confidence intervals, hypothesis tests (t-test, chi-square), ANOVA, correlation, regression, p-values.
- **When used:** When you want to generalize or test a claim about a larger group based on sample data.

- **Statistics**
  - **Descriptive**
    - Purpose: Describe data
    - Examples: mean/median/mode, std/variance, hist/boxplot
    - Output: Facts *about this dataset*
  - **Inferential**
    - Purpose: Conclude beyond data
    - Examples: CI, hypothesis tests, regression
    - Output: Probabilistic statements *about population*
